        <p>History and Mythology About Kedarnath</p>
        <p>According to Hindu mythology, the Kedarnath temple was built by the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, as a way to atone for their sins. Lord Shiva, who was being pursued by the Pandavas, took the form of a bull and disappeared into the ground at Kedarnath. The temple is believed to be built on the spot where Lord Shiva disappeared, and the lingam inside the temple is said to have been formed naturally by the elements of earth, air, water, and fire.

        <h1 style="border: 5px solid black;">Kedarnath Shrine was under Snow for 400 years</h1>
        <p>It is not accurate to say that Kedarnath was buried in snow for 400 years. According to historical records and local legends, the Kedarnath temple has faced several natural disasters, including heavy snowfall, landslides, and earthquakes, which have caused damage to the temple and its surrounding area. However, the temple has also undergone several renovations and rebuilding efforts throughout its history. The most recent disaster occurred in June 2013, when flash floods and landslides caused extensive damage to the temple and nearby villages. While the temple itself was not completely buried in snow, the surrounding area received significant snowfall, which caused damage to the infrastructure and made it difficult for pilgrims to reach the temple.</p>
